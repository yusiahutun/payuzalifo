For example, when you have children or when the children leave home. Moments when the old rules no longer apply — when you need to press the reset button and start again.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Well, the new trend for WFHF (working from home for ever) has presented us with a national reset button. If you are cooped up together ad infinitum, you need to address what this means for your relationship head-on.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-dfec1855edcc0ee9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/20/21/56849825-10736185-image-a-95_1650486795054.jpg height=545 width=634 alt="Melanie Perry (pictured) is one of many wives struggling to come to terms with the fact home life will never be the same again" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Melanie Perry (pictured) is one of many wives struggling to come to terms with the fact home life will never be the same again</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We plan for retirement — the point when most couples anticipate spending more time together — for years; whereas WFHF has just been dumped on us. What most couples have failed to realise is that it needs similar levels of thought and discussion.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you try to run the old marriage in new circumstances, you’re asking for trouble.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s a bit like having a stone in your shoe; it feels uncomfortable for a while but then it&nbsp;reaches a point when you cannot take another step.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Like many couples, Melanie and Colin found themselves in a battle over the study.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’ve worked from home for years in an office upstairs,’ says Melanie. ‘Colin immediately claimed it as his own in the first lockdown, citing a need for quiet, which meant I had to decamp begrudgingly to the dining table.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m not sure I was even consulted. It just happened. I had to prop my laptop up on a pile of books and sitting on a dining chair gave me backache.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Colin’s job involves endless video meetings, so I can’t make any noise. I just want the house to be my domain again.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Here we have a fundamental issue that needs to be discussed. The problem is we tend not to want to have tricky conversations like this because they’re really about how valuable each person’s contribution is to the relationship.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<span class=femail-ccox>We bought a 50in monitor for me and HE began using it</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>By September 2020, just before the second lockdown, Melanie had reached tipping point. ‘I started asking Colin, “When will you go back to the office?” because I felt I’d go mad if he didn’t,’ she says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We had an argument and I said I couldn’t carry on at the dining table. I’m a video and sound editor and I need to scrutinise sharp details, yet there I was working from a tiny laptop while he was in my office.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We tried investing in a 50- inch computer monitor for me as a solution, only for him to start using it. I was furious.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the end, Melanie staged a coup, waiting until Colin was at a rugby match to move his things into the dining room of their large, end-ofterrace home and hers back into the office.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I love Colin dearly but I’ve had enough of him being at home,’ says Melanie, who owns video marketing agency Poppy Perry Media.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He’s got an HR department checking on his happiness and wellbeing, but nobody asks if I’m OK. I can’t even rant to my friends on the phone because Colin’s in the house.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘On the occasional days when he does now go to the office, I’m sure I’m more pleasant to be around, because I don’t feel so resentful.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The issue of boundaries is one that all couples in this situation must face. How much of the day should compose of work? How can you make sure each partner has quiet when they need to make calls? Should you consider moving home if there isn’t enough work space for both of you?&nbsp;If you’re both WFHF, it really is that fundamental.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Colin says: ‘Now Melanie has her office back, she’s happier. I do understand how annoying it must have been for her that I was suddenly in her space, but it is my home, too.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I spend a lot of time on calls with clients so I need to be shut away in the office for that, whereas Melanie, being creative, is messy and much of her thinking is done out loud.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m happier than ever and more productive working at home, plus I love mowing the grass or chopping up logs at lunchtime or between meetings. It means we get more family time at weekends.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite tensions, the couple admit the situation has improved their ability to resolve conflicts.</p><img id=i-8c65fc38786db3db src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/20/21/56849839-10736185-image-a-96_1650486850442.jpg height=441 width=634 alt="Before the pandemic, Wendy Steer¿s husband Ashley, who works for an American real estate and investment company, was either working from his London office or on trips to see clients around Europe. Wendy and Ashley pictured" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Before the pandemic, Wendy Steer’s husband Ashley, who works for an American real estate and investment company, was either working from his London office or on trips to see clients around Europe. Wendy and Ashley pictured&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m organised and tidy, Melanie is more liberal and will leave the mess, which does annoy me, but we’ve each had to learn to be more tolerant,’ Colin reflects. ‘That’s just as well given I’m unlikely ever to return to the office full-time.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But not everyone is able to resolve their ongoing battles. Many have complained to me that long-term working from home has exposed domestic inequality. What I find repeatedly is that women complain men are merely ‘helping out’ at home rather than truly sharing the load.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Men compare themselves to other men they know and feel they are doing more than average. But women compare what their husband does with what they themselves do and find them lacking.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There’s also the matter of standards. A man might think he’s cleaning dishes with aplomb only for his partner to disagree. But who sets the standards? If you expect hospital theatre levels of cleanliness in the kitchen, is it fair to expect tasks to be divided 50/50? Conversation is key.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before the pandemic, Wendy Steer’s husband Ashley, who works for an American real estate and investment company, was either working from his London office or on trips to see clients around Europe.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ashley’s absences were part of family life for Wendy and the couple’s 16-year-old twins, a boy and a girl, giving her the space to run her own business from home.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, Ashley is two years into liaising with global clients from the family home in Lincolnshire. You might imagine that with a five-bed house, where Ashley works in a study downstairs and Wendy in her office upstairs, space wouldn’t be an issue. But like Melanie, Wendy, 50, a wellbeing consultant who’s worked from home for four years, missed having the house to herself.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<span class=femail-ccox>Every surface is cluttered with plates, cutlery and crumbs – and he wants to know what’s for dinner</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>She says: ‘There’s no division of labour. Ashley doesn’t think to do any washing or ironing because I’m here to do it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Yes he works longer hours and I’ve always managed my career around the kids — but I don’t like that the domestic load falls to me even now he’s around more.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In contrast Ashley, 48, revels in working from home. ‘I love not having early starts or sitting around in airports or on planes and trains, which was all just dead time,’ he says. ‘During the first spring lockdown of 2020, even though I was extremely busy with work, there was more time than ever before to enjoy the weather and our garden with my family.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Still, he has his own niggles too. ‘Wendy gets frustrated that I’m not on demand if she needs something doing in the house,’ he explains. ‘The point is that I’m at&nbsp;work and on calls all day. Mind you, I quite look forward to the days when she has meetings away from the house — so I do understand that she wishes she had the place to herself again.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m not sure Wendy will like this, but now that everyone’s so adept at virtual calls, I’ll probably always work from home.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Frustrations aren’t confined to couples where both are working from home. Primary school teacher Esha Seth, 39, spends her days in the classroom but that doesn’t lessen her irritation that husband Vishal, 40, is still working from their four-bed detached home in Cheshire. They have a daughter of ten and a son, five.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before the pandemic, Vishal’s career as an examiner for apprenticeship schemes meant he was out every day and often overnight too. ‘The house would be as immaculately tidy when I got home from work as when I left that morning,’ says Esha.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I used to squeeze in housework in the morning and after school, as I went along, to keep on top of everything. ‘Now Vishal does the afternoon school run and I arrive home to coats, shoes and schoolbags abandoned on the floor of our sizeable hallway.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘All he wants to know is, “What’s for dinner?” when he’s the one who’s been at home all day.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Every surface in the kitchen is cluttered with plates, cutlery and crumbs where he’s made his lunch and snacks for the children, and don’t even get me started on the dining room.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When a year had passed and Vishal was still holding the table hostage, I was eager to know when he’d be going back on the road.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Vishal says: ‘Esha doesn’t understand that when I get home with the kids, I have to work again straight away which means tidying up isn’t my priority.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I do love being a much more hands-on dad now, which I know Esha is secretly happy about, too. If only I wasn’t so messy.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To which Esha responds: ‘I do understand there’s little point in Vishal incurring travel and hotel costs when his work can now all be done on a screen.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But it’s me — and my lovely dining table — paying the price.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A heartfelt sentiment that is surely echoed in home-cumoffices up and down the country.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=mol-style-bold>Andrew G Marshall is a marital therapist and host of The Meaningful Life podcast</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2PcGpvaWhqfJiNsYeAh39djLyzt8innmagn6Kybr%2FPnqOlZZSewKK%2F056pZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZaGsnaE%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fwarning-working-home-spell-disaster-marriage-html.html&title=WARNING%3a%20Working%20from%20home%20could%20spell%20disaster%20for%20your%20marriage%21" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwarning-working-home-spell-disaster-marriage-html.html&description=WARNING%3a%20Working%20from%20home%20could%20spell%20disaster%20for%20your%20marriage%21" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwarning-working-home-spell-disaster-marriage-html.html&title=WARNING%3a%20Working%20from%20home%20could%20spell%20disaster%20for%20your%20marriage%21" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fwarning-working-home-spell-disaster-marriage-html.html&title=WARNING%3a%20Working%20from%20home%20could%20spell%20disaster%20for%20your%20marriage%21" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fwarning-working-home-spell-disaster-marriage-html.html&text=WARNING%3a%20Working%20from%20home%20could%20spell%20disaster%20for%20your%20marriage%21" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fwarning-working-home-spell-disaster-marriage-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-05-31</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./family-matters-celebrates-30-years-behind-the-scenes-secrets-of-the-successful-show-html.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Behind The Scenes Secrets of The Successful Show</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./miranda-lamberts-new-house-tennessee.html><h3>See Inside Miranda Lambert's Spectacular Tennessee Farm >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
